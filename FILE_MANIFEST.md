# Seestar Organizer: Automated File Manifest

*This manifest is auto-generated by parsing file headers.*

## 🛫 PREFLIGHT (Daytime)

* `core/preflight/fog_monitor.py`: Infrared sky-clarity monitor using MLX90614 to prevent imaging in fog.
* `core/preflight/gps.py`: Manages geographic coordinates using config.toml as the source of truth.
* `core/preflight/harvester.py`: Downloads active campaigns from AAVSO, vetoing targets outside FOV constraints.
* `core/preflight/horizon.py`: Veto targets based on local obstructions (Trees, Buildings) using Az/Alt mapping.
* `core/preflight/librarian.py`: Monthly cron tool to fetch NEW targets from AAVSO.
* `core/preflight/nightly_planner.py`: Scores targets against Haarlem ephemeris and generates tonights_plan.json.
* `core/preflight/preflight_master.py`: The definitive late-afternoon automated conductor.
* `core/preflight/target_evaluator.py`: Audits the nightly plan for freshness and quantity.
* `core/preflight/weather.py`: Calculates astronomical dark, fetches Open-Meteo & Buienradar forecasts, and returns a UTF-8 evaluated status.

## 🚀 FLIGHT (Nighttime)
* `core/flight/block_injector.py`: Transforms tonights_plan.json into 15-minute science blocks using config-driven coordinates.
* `core/flight/env_loader.py`: Centralized configuration and environment variable manager.
* `core/flight/fill_the_night.py`: Stress-test utility to saturate the Federation schedule for maximum night capacity.
* `core/flight/get_manifest.py`: Human-readable reporter for the current Alpaca Bridge flight schedule.
* `core/flight/hardware_profiles.py`: Define sensor specs for Annie (S50), Williamina (S30-Pro), and Henrietta (S30-Pro Fast).
* `core/flight/orchestrator.py`: Executes missions using a standardized API contract.
* `core/flight/preflight_check.py`: Executes full system validation including Targets, GPS, Bridge, Weather, and Disk.
* `core/flight/sequence_engine.py`: Prioritizes targets without crashing on vault attributes.
* `core/flight/vault_manager.py`: No objective defined.

## 🧪 POSTFLIGHT (Processing)
* `core/postflight/analyst.py`: Analyzes FITS image quality, FWHM, and basic observational metrics.
* `core/postflight/analyzer.py`: Simulates PSF/SNR analysis to test the v1.1 Dashboard feedback loop.
* `core/postflight/calibration_engine.py`: Manages Zero-Point (ZP) offsets and flat-field corrections for the IMX585.
* `core/postflight/master_analyst.py`: High-level plate-solving coordinator for narrow-field Seestar frames.
* `core/postflight/notifier.py`: Outbound alert management via Telegram and system bells.
* `core/postflight/pastinakel_math.py`: Logic for saturation detection and dynamic aperture scaling.
* `core/postflight/photometry_engine.py`: Instrumental flux extraction and science-grade lightcurve generation.
* `core/postflight/pixel_mapper.py`: Converts celestial WCS coordinates to local sensor pixel X/Y coordinates.
* `core/postflight/sync_manager.py`: Manages file synchronization between Seestar, Local Buffer, and NAS.

## 🛠️ UTILS & ROOT
* `core/utils/disk_monitor.py`: Verifies NAS and local USB/buffer storage availability across all flight phases.
* `utils/astro.py`: Core library for RA/Dec parsing, sidereal time, and coordinate math.
* `utils/audit_setup.py`: Dumps current Horizon and Target configuration for architectural review.
* `utils/auto_header.py`: ' not in content:
* `utils/check_headers.py`: Utility to verify all project Python files contain a Purpose header.
* `utils/cleanup.py`: Housekeeping for temporary files and logs.
* `utils/fix_imports.py`: No objective defined.
* `utils/generate_manifest.py`: Scrapes file headers to rebuild FILE_MANIFEST.md automatically.
* `utils/inject_location.py`: Dynamically synchronizes Bridge/Simulator location using config.toml as the source of truth.
* `utils/undo_header_mess.py`: No objective defined.
* `core/__init__.py`: No objective defined.
* `core/flight-to-post-handover.py`: Secures data after a mission, stops hardware bridges, and triggers post-flight analysis.
* `core/pre-to-flight-handover.py`: Evaluates the final preflight vitals. If safe, authorizes the FLIGHT phase. If unsafe, aborts the mission.
* `core/selector.py`: Prioritize targets setting in the West during the dark window.
* `core/sequence_repository.py`: Local cache manager for AAVSO V-band comparison sequences.
